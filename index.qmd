This <strong>laboratory course</strong> teaches the following topics through experiments and recitations: 

- Usage of basic of fluid properties, fluid statics 
- Laboratory-based application of Integral and differential formulations of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy
- Laboratory-based application Bernoulli’s equation, dimensional analysis and similitude
- Applications of inviscid and viscous flow. 
- Experiments and introductory-level Python Programming in fluid mechanics

Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.

## Expand To Learn About Collapse

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.
