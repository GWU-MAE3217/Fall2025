This course teaches the basics of fluid properties, fluid statics, integral and
differential formulations of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. As well as Bernoulli’s
equation, dimensional analysis and similitude, and both inviscid and viscous flow. Experimental
and computational methods in fluid mechanics will be discussed.

The attached course outline is subject to change depending on the pace of the class. Pay
attention to the location of each meeting. Sometimes you will be in the GW assigned classroom,
and sometimes you will be in the Fluids Lab.

<strong>The attendees will be expected to bring their own laptops, books and writing instruments</strong>

<strong>The students will be expected to work </strong>

- in small groups using a limited number of hardware components and WiFi connectivity that will be provided.

## Expand To Learn About Collapse

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.
