  <tr>
    <td width="70%">
      
      Dr. Kartik V. Bulusu is an Associate Research Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at The George Washington University, Washington DC. 
      
      He designed taught a cross-disciplinary course titled, Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing with applications in cyber-physical systems and speech processing. 
      
      In addition, he developed courses for first year engineering students on the engineering applications of Raspberry Pi, Python programming and mobile App development inspired by social innovation potential during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      
      His research interests span the areas of human health and sustainable energy with focus on mechanics of biological fluids, low-cost energy technologies and applications of wavelet transforms. His current research work on biofluid dynamics of the cardiovasculature, rheology of biological fluids and applications of wavelet transforms has been supported by NSF and the Center for Biomimetics and Bioinspired Engineering (CBBE), GWU.  
      
      He developed a wavelet transform-based computational code (PIVlet) for the analysis of complex vortical patterns encountered in arterial blood flow. He has extensive knowledge of experimental fluid mechanics and non-invasive measurement techniques such as laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV), particle image velocimetry (PIV), schlieren imagery, magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV) and molecular tagging velocimetry (MTV). Dr. Bulusu was recognized with the ASME Best Paper Award by the Advanced Energy Systems Division (AESD) Heat Pump Technical Committee, William and Louise Corcoron Award for contributing to the intellectual and social life and the Bender award for teaching excellence in the School of Engineering and Applied Science, GWU.

## Bengisu Sisik (Graduate Teaching Assistant)
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="60%">
  Bengisu Sisik is a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at The George Washington University, specializing in additive manufacturing of thermoelectric semiconductor materials. Her research focuses on process–structure–property relationships during laser powder bed fusion, leveraging high-performance computing and advanced simulation tools to design sustainable energy solutions. She has published in Nature Energy and actively engages in interdisciplinary initiatives at the intersection of materials science, energy, and data-driven modeling.
  Beyond research, she is a Graduate Ambassador at GWU, mentoring new students and fostering inclusivity in STEM. She also serves as the Inaugural Chair of the American Society of Thermal and Fluids Engineers (ASTFE) Student Committee, where she encourages every student with an interest in thermal and fluids sciences to join the community.
  Outside of work, Bengisu enjoys exploring new cities, practicing yoga, and playing tennis. She also warmly invites anyone interested to visit Turkey.

## Swastika Bera (Graduate Teaching Assistant)
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="60%">
Swastika Bera is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at George Washington University, specializing in fluid mechanics and soft matter. Her doctoral research focuses on the deformation, breakup, and particle tracking of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), xanthan gum, and marine snow under laminar and turbulent flows, with implications for marine carbon flux. She previously earned her M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from South Dakota State University, where she developed corn kernel-based biocomposite films for food packaging applications, advancing sustainable alternatives to conventional plastics. Her research interests include biopolymers, rheology, experimental fluid dynamics, and advanced imaging techniques.
