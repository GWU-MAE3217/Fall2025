**By the end of the course, you should be able to**

1. Demonstrate an understanding of fluid properties including the measure of the property and its dependence on pressure and temperature.

2. Demonstrate the ability to solve hydrostatic problems involving manometers, hydrostatic forces on planar and curved surfaces, and hydraulics.

3. Demonstrate the ability to solve fluid dynamics problems involving conservation of mass, momentum, and energy for viscous and inviscid flow.

4. Demonstrate an understanding of similitude and dimensional analysis. Correctly apply these concepts to fluids problems.

5. Demonstrate an ability to apply mathematics and physics to problems involving fluid mechanics.
